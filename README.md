### Neural Network
The neural network is fully connected with 4 layers:
 - input layer with 6 neurons
 - 2 hidden layers: 4 neurons and 2 neurons 
 - output layer with just 1 neuron

The hidden layers use tanh activation function and a sigmoid activation function at the output layer

- The genetic algorithm is used to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network.
- The weights and biases form the genes of the gnomes ranging between -1 and 1.

# gnomes
- The starting population is initiated with completely random genes
- Subsequent populations are generated by crossing 2 parents from the outgoing population

#### Genes
- Each gene is treated as separate
- Gene selection from the parents is random but with a higher probability of the fittest parent's gene being picked ( 5:4 )

#### Parent Pool
- After each population the parent pool for the next generation consists of all the gnomes from the outgoing population
- The parents are selected such that the top 4 fittest gnomes have a higher decreasing probability of being parents
- That is the fittest have the highest followed by the second fittest and so on

#### Crossover
- Genes are passed on to the child based on chances but with a 60% chance of the fittest gnomes gene being picked

#### Mutation
- Mutation is done by chance
- New random genes are generated incase of mutation and then no need for a crossover


### Usage
You dont need much to run
Just clone the repo and host with your trusted webserver
